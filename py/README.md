# unimcp — Python binding

Distributed as `lituus-unimcp`, imported as `unimcp`: the two names
are separate decisions, and the bare names are not all available on PyPI.

```bash
pip install lituus-unimcp
```

From a checkout, `build/unigate pyTest` builds the extension and runs the tests
in one step. The pieces, if you want them apart:

```bash
build/unigate pyLib          # the C library the extension links against
build/unigate buildCython    # the extension, in place
build/unigate pyWheel        # a wheel in py/dist/
```

```python
import unimcp

unimcp.version()        # the C library's version
unimcp.FIB_MAX_N        # 92, read from the C header, not restated here
unimcp.fibonacci(10)    # 55
```

`fibonacci` raises `TypeError` for a non-int and `ValueError` outside
`[0, FIB_MAX_N]`. The C ABI clamps instead of reporting; the binding is where
the domain becomes an error, because Python callers expect one.
